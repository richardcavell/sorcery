Sorcery version 1.3
https://github.com/richardcavell/sorcery

This project is intended for the TRS-80 Color Computer 3.  It is a very
simple program that does something strange to the cursor.  It does not
work on a Color Computer 1 or 2.

This makefile allows you to run the program on an emulated Coco 3.  Type
"make info" to see your options.  When the emulated machine starts to run,
don't do anything! MAME will automatically type out the correct command and
run it.

Paul Barton posted some BASIC code to Facebook on 16 March 2019.  This
project preserves that code snippet on GitHub, and provides a Makefile
and downloadable disk image for you to use.

The BASIC code and the underlying trick are not my intellectual property.
I remember that the underlying trick was known in the early 1990s, but I
don't know who first came up with it.

Any component of this project that is my intellectual property, I release
under the MIT license.

This project is complete. I will review it from time to time. The last review
occurred in May 2025.
