Any component of this project that is my intellectual property, I release

This project is intended for the TRS-80 Color Computer 3.  It is a very
simple program that does something strange to the cursor.

The underlying code was posted to Facebook on 16 March 2019, by Paul Barton.
I have packaged that code as a downloadable disk image and I have provided a
Makefile for you to use.
