Sorcery version 1.0
https://github.com/richardcavell/sorcery

Paul Barton posted some BASIC code to Facebook on 16 March 2019.  This
project preserves that code snippet on github, and provides a Makefile
and downloadable disk image for you to use.

The BASIC code and the underlying trick that it produces are not my
intellectual property.  Any component of this project that is my
intellectual property, I release under the MIT license.

This project is intended for the TRS-80 Color Computer 3.  It is a very
simple program that does something strange to the cursor.

When the emulated machine starts to run, don't do anything! MAME will
automatically type out the correct command and run it.
